## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does as well as any other information you want users or other developers to have.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called _{ProjectName}.Solution_.
3. In the command line, run the command ``dotnet run`` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
4. Optionally, you can run ``dotnet build`` to compile this console app without running it.

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
